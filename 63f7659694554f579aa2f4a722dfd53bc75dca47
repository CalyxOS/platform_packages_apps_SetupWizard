      "message": "Yes, `finishAction` sounds right. We don\u0027t want to change that the page would appear in any form when going backwards if it was skipped while going forwards. Sounds like that\u0027s a benefit `finishAction` would provide. If you\u0027re working on this relation chain, can you update it to use that?",
