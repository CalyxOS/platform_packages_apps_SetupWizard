    <string name="microg_description">This allows apps such as <b>Google Maps, Youtube and ride sharing services</b> to run on CalyxOS. Disable this if you don\'t plan on running apps that require Google services. You will not be able to enable it later.</string>
    <string name="microg_defaults_switch_label">Push notification support</string>
    <string name="microg_defaults_summary">Allow apps to register for push notifications with Google. This registers your device to Google services, without any device-specific unique identifiers. This can be enabled later from microG Settings, however any apps setup earlier will need to be re-installed to work properly.</string>

    <string name="microg_location_summary">Improve location services by querying MLS (Mozilla Location Services) with nearby Wi-Fi and cellular networks, using Nominatim for address lookups, and remembering GPS coordinates of nearby networks.
