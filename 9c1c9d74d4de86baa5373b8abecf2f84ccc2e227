      "message": "It may not be the best idea for this class to reference its subclasses like this. BaseSetupWizardActivity shouldn\u0027t need to even know what its subclasses are. I made this mistake in an [Aperture change once](https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_packages_apps_Aperture/+/347850/comments/23eb273b_82c553ce) and was reminded of that. Some more info here: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/219543/should-a-class-know-about-its-subclasses\n\nThis does work, but I suppose a better approach code-wise could be to add something that the subclass can set or override to indicate that it doesn\u0027t want the extras added.",
