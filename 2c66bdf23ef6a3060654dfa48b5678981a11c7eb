      "message": "Changes in PS37:\n- isProvisioningAllowed -\u003e getProvisioningState; now we can know whether it\u0027s unsupported, still pending, or complete.\n- Brought back exitIfSetupComplete. We do not exit if provisioning is still pending... but now I think that\u0027s wrong. I\u0027m going to change it so that it doesn\u0027t exit if provisioning is supported at all, and that will make the behavior match pre-PS37, for garlic-level only.\n\nThe net result should be, for Standard (or no garlic-level page), no visible change for users. Otherwise, SUW might still pop up at the end, but we can figure that out separately.",
