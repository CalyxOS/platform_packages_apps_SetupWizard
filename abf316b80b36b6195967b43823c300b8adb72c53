      "message": "Oops, I was wrong.\n\nBefore this change, we only hid the next button; we didn\u0027t do anything with the back button. We want the back button to be gone, too, since going backwards after a certain point-of-no-return (e.g. the animation) can cause problems, crashes, weird behavior.\n\nAnd in the place where we hide the next button, we also want to hide the back button. So I made a method that does both.\n\nI guess it could be in SetupWizardUtils, but I wasn\u0027t thinking of that.\n\nThe commit message should be updated.",
