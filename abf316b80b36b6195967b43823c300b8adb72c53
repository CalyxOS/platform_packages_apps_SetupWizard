      "message": "Oops, I was wrong.\n\nBefore this change, we only hid the next button; we didn\u0027t do anything with the back button. We want the back button to be gone, too, since going backwards after a certain point-of-no-return (e.g. the animation) can cause problems, crashes, weird behavior.\n\nAnd in the place where we hide the next button, we also want to hide the back button. So I made a method that does both.\n\nI guess it could be in SetupWizardUtils, but I wasn\u0027t thinking of that.\n\nThe commit message should be updated.",

When sFinishState isn\u0027t NONE, that means we\u0027ve reached a point of no return. The animation is going, or (in later patches) provisioning is going. Without the provisioning steps, the wizard should just exit on its own after the animation. With the provisioning steps, we have other failure handling that ensures the device must be wiped. In neither situation do we need to enable navigating backwards or forwards.\n\nNote that disabling navigation is not at a system level but at the SUW app level.",
