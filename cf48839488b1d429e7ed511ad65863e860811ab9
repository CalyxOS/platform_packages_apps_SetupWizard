Like it\u0027s transitioning from the biometric screen, which is briefly avoided in order to show the prerequisite screen for setting a PIN?\n\nNot sure if there is an extras flag or something to get Settings to use our transitions.\n\nCan just mark this Resolved for now if it seems too tricky/time-consuming or not worth it.",
