Like it\u0027s transitioning from the biometric screen, which is briefly avoided in order to show the prerequisite screen for setting a PIN?\n\nNot sure if there is an extras flag or something to get Settings to use our transitions.\n\nCan just mark this Resolved for now if it seems too tricky/time-consuming or not worth it.",

That said I guess we could check stock (if it is different I would suspect they may have reimplemented the page rather than are executing the AOSP one with extra flags).\nThat said, we can definitely add code to Settings to have it apply the animations if wanted.",
