It does not work initially (lock symbol only); however, it should start working if the screen is allowed to time out first, or it may transform into a fingerprint symbol if the user waits several seconds and then pulls down Quick Settings. Manually turning the screen off and on will result in fingerprint not working at all until unlocked with PIN.\n* With 4 fingerprints for the secondary user, as opposed to only 2, this same behavior also happens when switching back to a running secondary user, instead of being limited to the Owner user.",
