      "message": "This patchset is an improvement, but it still doesn\u0027t look like the actual wallpaper. I\u0027m about to replace it with a change that is a slightly different style - a circular hide rather than a circular reveal - but which I think works better, at least on phones (haven\u0027t tested on other devices). Due to the way the new method works, which involves using a transparent background that shows the wallpaper, it\u0027s not possible to use a circular reveal, but I think it looks pretty good. Feel free to return to this patchset if needed.",
