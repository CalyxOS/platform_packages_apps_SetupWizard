      "message": "This appears to work just fine. It also fixes the inability to skip the SUW properly in userdebug/eng builds. I think most of the problems that kept the exit procedure so complicated were already solved in previous changes.\n\nThere are some CalyxOS-specific movements here, like for provisioning defaults, that will need to be accounted for when sending upstream.",
