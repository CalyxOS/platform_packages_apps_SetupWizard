      "message": "@olivercscott@gmail.com pointed out that CalyxOS actually does use subactivity features for SimMissingActivity, for launching eSIM setup, whereas LineageOS does not. Having LineageOS use a subactivity was convenient for CalyxOS alone. But I think it\u0027s fine for us to have this be one of the ways we diverge - better (imo) to diverge here than to have upstream look confusing and wrong just for our benefit.\n\nI\u0027ll adjust this.",
